# nowsecure-jenkins-ci-plugin

NowSecure provides purpose-built, fully automated mobile application security testing (static and dynamic) for your development pipeline.
By testing your mobile application binary post-build from Jenkins, NowSecure ensures comprehensive coverage of newly developed code, third party components, and system dependencies.

NowSecure quickly identifies and details real issues, provides remediation recommendations, and integrates with ticketing systems such as Azure DevOps and Jira.

This integration requires a NowSecure platform license. See <https://www.nowsecure.com> for more information.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This Jenkins plugin requires the following plugins:
- Credentials: https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/
- Plain Credentials: https://plugins.jenkins.io/plain-credentials/

These plugins are already installed in over 90% of Jenkins instances according to usage statistics, so most consumers of this plugin will not need to explicitly install these.

Note: This plugin will require the minimum Jenkins version as specified by the above two plugins. At the moment, that's version 2.479 requiring Java 17 or Java 21.

### Installation

First, find this extension in the [Jenkins Plugin Marketplace](https://plugins.jenkins.io/)

Then install it following [Jenkin's instructions](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) on installing marketplace plugins.

**NOTE:** Currently, compatibility is limited to either Windows / Linux running an X64 architecture, or MacOS on ARM.
In order for the extension to work, please make sure you are running on an appropriate `vmImage`.

### Configuration

To add this component to your CI/CD pipeline, the following should be done:

- Get a token from your NowSecure platform instance. More information on this can be found in the [NowSecure Support Portal](https://support.nowsecure.com/hc/en-us/articles/7499657262093-Creating-a-NowSecure-Platform-API-Bearer-Token).
- Identify the ID of the group in NowSecure Platform that you want your assessment to be included in. More information on this can be found in the
  [NowSecure Support Portal](https://support.nowsecure.com/hc/en-us/articles/38057956447757-Retrieve-Reference-and-ID-Numbers-for-API-Use-Task-ID-Group-App-and-Assessment-Ref).
- Add a `StringCredentials` secret as shown in the documentation for the [Plain Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/plain-credentials/#plugin-content-description).
  Set the `Secret` to the value of the token created above.
